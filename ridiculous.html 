   <h2>Water Bottle Notes</h2>
   <p><b>The</b> <i>most</i> ridiculous rule I have encountere<sup>d</sup>, was in grade school<br> when we needed a note to carry a <sub>water</sub> bottle to class with us.<br> My teachers would throw the bottle away if you either didn’t have a note, or it wasn’t written by your doctor.<br> My teacher Mrs. Dunfee, was especially strict with this rule.</p>
   <p> It was the <del>worst</del> <ins>best</ins> <s>apple</s>...I mean avacado she had ever had.</p>
